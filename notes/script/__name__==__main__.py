# if __name__ == __main__: (his script can be imported OR run standalone)
# Fuctions and classes in this module can be reused without the main block of code executing
# Good practice (Code is modular, 
#                helps readability,
#                leaves no global variables,
#                avoid unintended execution)

#                Ex. lirary = import library for functionality
#                    When running library directly, display a help page
